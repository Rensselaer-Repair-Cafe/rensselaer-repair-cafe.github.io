		<p>
A Repair Café is a free meeting place where people come together to repair things that they normally thrown away. We provide the tools and materials to help you make any repairs you need, and will have volunteers with repair skills in all kinds of fields ready to provide advice or a helping hand. Bring broken items from home, such as clothes, small furniture, electrical appliances, bicycles, toys, etc., and start making repairs together with the specialists. It’s an ongoing learning process. If you have nothing to repair, you can enjoy a cup of tea or coffee, or some delicious home cooked food. Or you can lend a hand with someone else’s repair job. You can also get inspired at the reading table – by leafing through books on repairs and DIY.
